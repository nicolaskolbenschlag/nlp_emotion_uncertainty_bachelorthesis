# Calibrated and Uncertainty-aware Multimodal Emotion Recognition

This repository contains the code for my bachelorthesis at University of Augsburg.

## MuSe 2021

The [dataset](https://www.muse-challenge.org/) used in this project.

## Quantification of predictive uncertainty

The first step for getting appropriate measuremets of predictive uncertainty. Therefore we provide a extensive overview about recent approaches.

## Measurement of predictive uncertainty

Additionally we developed an approach for confirming the feasibility of quantifying predictive uncertainty by such a method.

## Example

### Uncalibrated confidence

<p>This plot shows the <span style="color: blue">ymodel's prediction</p> and the quantified uncertainty (lightblue). As larger the lightblue area, as less confident was the model in its prediction.</p>
