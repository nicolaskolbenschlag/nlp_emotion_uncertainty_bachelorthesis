The [dataset](https://www.muse-challenge.org/) used in this project.

## Quantification of predictive uncertainty

The first step for getting appropriate measuremets of predictive uncertainty. Therefore we provide a extensive overview about recent approaches.

## Measurement of predictive uncertainty

Additionally we developed an approach for confirming the feasibility of quantifying predictive uncertainty by such a method.
